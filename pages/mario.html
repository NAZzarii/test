    <p class="mario_text">Mario is a character created by Japanese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto. He is the title character of the Mario
    franchise and the mascot of Japanese video game company Nintendo. Mario has appeared in over 200 video games since his
    creation. Depicted as a short, pudgy, Italian plumber who resides in the Mushroom Kingdom, his adventures generally
    center on rescuing Princess Peach from the Koopa villain Bowser. Mario has access to a variety of power-ups that give
    him different abilities. Mario's fraternal twin brother is Luigi.
    
    Mario first appeared as the player character of Donkey Kong (1981), a platform game. Miyamoto wanted to use Popeye as
    the protagonist, but when he could not achieve the licensing rights, he created Mario instead. Miyamoto expected the
    character to be unpopular and planned to use him for cameo appearances; originally called "Mr. Video", he was renamed to
    Mario after Mario Segale. Mario's clothing and characteristics were themed after the setting of Donkey Kong. He then
    began to star in the Super Mario series of platform games, beginning with the critically acclaimed Super Mario Bros. in
    1985. Since 1992, Mario has been voiced by Charles Martinet.
    
    After Super Mario Bros., Mario began to branch off to different genres. These include puzzle games such as Dr. Mario,
    role-playing games such as Paper Mario and Mario & Luigi, and sports games such as Mario Kart and Mario Tennis. He has
    appeared in other Nintendo properties, such as in the Super Smash Bros. series of crossover fighting games. Mario has
    also appeared in various animations, including three series produced by DIC Entertainment (voiced by Lou Albano and
    later Walker Boone), and was portrayed by Bob Hoskins in the 1993 Super Mario Bros. film. He will be voiced by Chris
    Pratt in the upcoming 2023 film adaptation.</p>
